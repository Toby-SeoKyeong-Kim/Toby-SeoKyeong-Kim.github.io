           <div class="bio">
             <p>When I first started college, my goal was to be a professional musician. However, that was until I met this mentor, Dr. Richard Boulanger. He taught me Csound and Circuit bending. And those classes taught me signal processing in depth and made me want to further study.</p>

             <p>As I was implementing my ideas, I needed to study more advanced techniques. I studied basic physics engine and math behind it through the book ‘The Nature of Code’ and studied generative media art.
             </p>

             <p>My overall programming experience has been learning new techniques over and over. First, it was Csound and Arduino and then Processing. And then I wanted to make a music related service online, I started web dev and became a full stack web developer.
             </p>

             <p>My most recent work was this South Korean government funded project “Contents Impact 2021”.  Even though it was a short-term project from Jun to November, I led a team and we managed to develop working prototype of VR DJing game with C++ and Unreal Engine with no prior knowledge of Unreal Engine. It involved numbers of udemy courses, relentless googling, stack overflow copy & paste, digging Unreal Engine’s source code, spending 12 hours a day and adapting those new knowledges right into the project. Which tells that my specialty is adaptation.
             </p>

             <p> As I have various development experience, I am open to a challenge of learning new techniques or developing in a new environment. Give me a development challenge, I will eventually do it. </p>
